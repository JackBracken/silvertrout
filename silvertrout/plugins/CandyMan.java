/**
 * CandyMan - Example plugin for Silvertrout IRC bot framework.
 *
 * This is a rather useless plugin but it demonstrates some vital parts of the
 * framework so its at least a good example on how to do things. The plugin is
 * still a work in progress.
 *
 * To create a plugin you create a class that extends silvertrout.Plugin and
 * override (with @Override) the on-methods you want to implement. There are
 * many methods like this. A few examples are onTick, onPrivmsg, onMode, onLoad
 * and onQuit. Make sure you put your plugin in the silvertrout.plugins package
 * too.
 *
 * If you plan to do computation or run external programs or something that may
 * take more then a 10th of second or so you may want to use threads so your 
 * plugin do not disrupt what the bot is otherwise doing.
 *
 * @see silvertrout.Plugin
